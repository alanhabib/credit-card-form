### This is a work test. There are three parts in this test, the first two code challenges are:

### Code Challenge

Part 1 - Algorithms

1.1

Write a function that finds and removes instances of four identical consecutive lowercase letters. The function should delete as a few letters as possible.

Assume that the maximum length of the string is 150 000 however please ellaborate on changes you would do if the maximum length would be 20 million or higher?

Examples:

"ffdttttyy" should return "ffdtttyy"
"iiikigggg" should return "iiikiggg"
1.2

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits have an odd sum.

Assume that the array contains between 1 and 150 000 elements and that each element is within the range of 1 to 1 500 000.

Examples:

[19, 2, 42, 18] should return 61
[61, 32, 51] should return 93

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
